Ans 1: Statically typed:-Programming Languages are referred as "static typed" if the memory of the variable is provided at the time of 
       compilation.
       Dynamically typed:-Programming languages are said to be "dynamically typed" if the memory for the Variable is provided at the 
       time of execution.

Ans 2: Variable:-A variable is the name of memory allocated reserved area. It may be thought of as the name of a memory location in other words.

Ans 3: To assign a value in a variable 
       Syntax: data_type var_name= value;
       Example: int a=5;

Ans 4: Primitive Data Types:- Primitive data types specify the size and type of variable values.
       They are the building blocks of data manipulation and cannot be further divided into simpler data types.

Ans 5: Identifiers:-dentifiers in Java are symbolic names used for identification.
       They can be a class name, variable name, method name, package name, constant name, and more. 

Ans 6: Operators in Java can be classified into six types:-
       1. Arithmetic Operator.
       2. Relational Operator.
       3. Logical Operator.
       4. Assignment Operator.
       5. Unary Operator.
       6. Bitwise Operator.

Ans 7: Increment Operator:-The increment (++) operator (also known as increment unary operator) in Java is used to increase the value of a variable by 1.
       Decrement Operator:-Decrement as the name implies is used to reduce the value of a variable by 1.
